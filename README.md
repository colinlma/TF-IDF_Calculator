# TF-IDF_Calculator

This assignment was a project for CS121 Information Retrieval. I wrote all of the classes and designed the system myself. I did some research on how to calculate the TF-IDF since this was let open ended for the assignment. Eventually, I decided on an "easy" implementation modeled after http://www.tfidf.com/.

We specifically could not use libraries to calculate the TF-IDF such as lucene. 

As this is not meant to actually be used by others I won't have instructions on how to run the code. However, all the necessary files are here with the exception of the following dependencies:
gson
jsoup
