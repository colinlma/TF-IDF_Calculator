#README
This was assigned as a project at UCI's CS 121: Information Retrieval

The purpose of the assignment was to display our understanding 
Term-Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scoring.

We were given very little directions and was given freedom on how to implement
our TF-IDF. I decided to use an implementation adapated from
http://www.tfidf.com/ as it seemed simple and close (if not identical) to what we talked about it in 
lecture.

Note: The intention is that this is to be viewed rather than developed. I have given all necessary
files with 1001 text files that were given to me to use as our corpora (though the original had ~50,000).
Therefore, there will be minimal instructions on how to get the code working.

I have written and designed everything myself for this part of the project. This is phase 1, but my team
 is currently in phase 2 though the vast majority of my own work is now finished. We were specifically
 asked to not use libraries that did most of the work for us such as lucene.
